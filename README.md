## Branching Strategy
- When a ticket is picked up, please create a new branch for work associated with that ticket. We will be using develop to branch off from, and merge back in to. 
- When you're finished with your code and have done the necessary testing required, you'll need to create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch back in to develop. Your need to get at least one review on your PR before it can be merged.
- Periodically, when the code in develop has been tested on the real robot and we are comfortable with where things are at, or we're about to go to competition, we will merge develop back in to main. When we do this, we'll also create a new tag against main.
